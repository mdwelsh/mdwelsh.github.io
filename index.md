I am a computer scientist and engineering manager at Google, where I work in the areas of mobile computing,
distributed systems, and networking. I lead the Chrome Cloud team, which spans multiple subteams:
[Chrome Sync](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/165139?hl=en)
(synchronizing bookmarks, settings, tab history across a user's devices);
[Chrome Data Saver](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2392284?hl=en)
(a proxy service to compress web pages);
[Google Cloud Messaging](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/) support
in Chrome; and multiple projects to improve Chrome's performance and functionality in emerging markets.

Prior to joining Google, I was a professor of Computer Science at
[Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science) from
2003 until 2010, and a senior researcher at
[Intel Research](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/intel-research.html), Berkeley
from 2002-2003. I did my PhD in Computer Science at [UC Berkeley](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/) (2002)
and my bachelor's in Computer Science at [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) (1996).

My research interests span a broad range of topics in the space of mobile computing,
operating systems, networks, distributed systems, and programming languages.
