Here are some of the non-research projects I've been involved with.
See my [research page](/research) for more information on academic work.

## Large Language Models as a new computing platform

My current fascination is with the potential of Large Language Models
(LLMs) as a new computing platform. LLMs like GPT-4 are showing the signs
of being able to solve problems and complete complex tasks using
a natural language interface, and I believe that this development points
to a new kind of natural-language computer.

My first startup, [Fixie.ai](https://fixie.ai), was originally working on
a developer platform to help companies leverage these powers of LLMs in their
own applications. We raised $17M in seed funding from top-tier VCs in early
2023, and had thousands of developers building on our platform. I left Fixie
after the company pivoted into a very different space in early 2024, but I
am continuing to work in this space.

## Optimizing ML models for deployment

I worked at both [OctoML](https://octoml.ai) and
[Xnor.ai](https://www.xnor.ai) on optimizing and deploying machine
learning models. OctoML was founded by the creators of [Apache
TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/), an optimizing compiler for ML models.
TVM takes a deep learning model and compiles it into highly efficient
and auto-tuned machine code for the target hardware. Apart from
TVM, at OctoML I was involved in building their cloud-based service
to measure, tune, and package ML models for a wide range of hardware
backends.

At [Xnor.ai](https://www.xnor.ai), I worked on optimizing ML models
(primarily for machine vision) to run efficiently on embedded devices
like microcontrollers.  When Xnor was acquired by Apple, our team's
technology was integrated into Apple's on-device AI platform.

## Bringing the web to the next billion users

I spent 8 years at Google as a Principal Engineer and engineering
director for the Chrome Mobile team in Seattle. Our team focused
on making Chrome and the web great for the next billion users in
markets such as India, Africa, and Southeast Asia. We developed new
browser capabilities and cloud services to make the web faster and
use less data.

Some of my team's projects at Google included:

* [Chrome Data Saver](/papers/flywheel-nsdi15.pdf), allowing Chrome to save more than 60% of mobile data
* Network optimizations for [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) and [QUIC](https://www.chromium.org/quic)
* New techniques for optimizing web content using cloud rendering
* Support for saving, reading, and preloading [offline pages](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7343019?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en)
* Web platform API support for mobile adaptations - [Netinfo ECT](https://wicg.github.io/netinfo/#effective-connection-types), [Save-Data hints](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/save-data)
* Developing new browser capabilities to help users discover new web content and more effectively multitask on small screens

## Personal projects

I love hacking and building stuff.
