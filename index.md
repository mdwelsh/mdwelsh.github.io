I am the SVP of Engineering at [OctoML](https://octoml.ai), a Seattle-based startup
developing technology to optimize and secure machine learning models for deployment.
OctoML is developing [Apache TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/), an optimizing compiler for
ML models, as well as cloud-based services to measure, tune, and package ML models for
a wide range of hardware backends.

My research interests span a broad range of topics in the space of machine learning systems,
mobile computing, operating systems, networks, distributed systems, and programming languages.

Prior to OctoML, I was an engineering lead and computer scientist at [Apple](https://www.apple.com), working on
the Machine Intelligence team in Seattle. My team specialized in optimized on-device AI.

Prior to Apple, I was a Principal Engineer at [Xnor.ai](https://www.xnor.ai), a startup developing
efficient AI for embedded systems. I led Xnor's Platform and Systems team, focusing on our high-performance
inference engine. Xnor was acquired by Apple in early 2020.

Prior to Xnor, I spent 8 years at Google as a Principal Engineer and engineering director for the Chrome Mobile
team in Seattle. Our team focused on making Chrome and the web great for the next billion users, developing new
browser capabilities to make the web faster and use less data.

Some of our team's projects included:

* [Chrome Data Saver](/papers/flywheel-nsdi15.pdf), allowing Chrome to save more than 60% of mobile data
* Network optimizations for [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) and [QUIC](https://www.chromium.org/quic)
* New techniques for optimizing web content using cloud rendering
* Support for saving, reading, and preloading [offline pages](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7343019?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en)
* Web platform API support for mobile adaptations - [Netinfo ECT](https://wicg.github.io/netinfo/#effective-connection-types), [Save-Data hints](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/save-data)
* Developing new browser capabilities to help users discover new web content and more effectively multitask on small screens

Prior to joining Google, I was a Professor of Computer Science at
[Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science) from 2003 until 2010. 
My research group at Harvard focused on operating systems, networking, and novel applications
of wireless sensor networks, consisting of tiny, battery-powered devices capable of collecting
data and communicating locally via a low-power wireless radio. Some of our research projects included:

* [Monitoring active volcanoes](/papers/volcano-osdi06.pdf) with sensor networks. Working with
  geophysicists from UNC, UNH, and the [Instituto Geofísico](https://www.igepn.edu.ec/) in Ecuador,
  we deployed sensors at Volcáns Tunguruahua and Reventador in Ecuador, collecting infrasound
  and seismic measurements.
* [Pixie](/papers/pixie-sensys08.pdf), an operating system for resource-aware programming, a new
  approach to managing scarce resources in heavily constrained embedded systems.
* [Mercury](/papers/mercury-sensys09.pdf), a wearable sensor platform for high-resolution motion
  analysis.
* Using wearable sensors for measuring [motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's Disease](/papers/parkinsons-titb09.pdf),
  in collaboration with researchers at the [Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital](https://spauldingrehab.org/).
* Wireless sensors for [emergency and mass casualty response](/papers/aidn-ieeehst08.pdf), in
  collaboration with researchers at JHU and Boston University.
* [CitySense](/papers/citysense-ieeehst08.pdf), an urban-scale wireless sensor testbed, consisting
  of wireless sensor nodes deployed across lightpoles in Cambridge, MA. In collaboration with BBN
  Technologies.
* [Cobra](/papers/cobra-nsdi07.pdf), a content-based distributed RSS feed aggregator.
* [IDEA](/papers/idea-mobisys10.pdf), an approach to distributed energy management in a sensor
  network.
* [MoteLab](/papers/motelab-spots05.pdf), an open wireless sensor network testbed.
* [Regiment](/papers/regiment-ipsn07.pdf), a language and runtime for macroprogramming of
  sensor networks.
* [Argos](/papers/argos-sensys10.pdf), a system for distributed measurement of WiFi network traffic
  in an urban setting.
* [Flask](/papers/flask-icfp08.pdf), a functional programming language for sensor networks.
* [Karma](/papers/karma-sensys11.pdf), a programming system for distributed micro-aerial vehicle
  swarms. This research was conducted as part of the
  [RoboBees](https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/robobees-autonomous-flying-microrobots/) project.
* [SORA](/papers/sora-nsdi05.pdf), an approach to decentralized resource allocation in sensor
  networks.
* [WhiteFi](/papers/whitefi-sigcomm09.pdf), a WiFi-like network system operating over UHF
  whitespaces, in collaboration with Microsoft Research.
