  My research interests.

I was previously a Professor of Computer Science at
[Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science) from 2003 to 2010.
My research group at Harvard focused on operating systems, networking, and novel applications
of wireless sensor networks, consisting of tiny, battery-powered devices capable of collecting
data and communicating locally via a low-power wireless radio.

See my [publications and talks page](/pubs) for a list of my papers and talks.

See my [students page](/students) for more information on my students, advisees,
and postdocs.

Some of our research projects included:

* [Monitoring active volcanoes](/papers/volcano-osdi06.pdf) with sensor networks. Working with
  geophysicists from UNC, UNH, and the [Instituto Geofísico](https://www.igepn.edu.ec/) in Ecuador,
  we deployed sensors at Volcáns Tunguruahua and Reventador in Ecuador, collecting infrasound
  and seismic measurements.
* [Pixie](/papers/pixie-sensys08.pdf), an operating system for resource-aware programming, a new
  approach to managing scarce resources in heavily constrained embedded systems.
* [Mercury](/papers/mercury-sensys09.pdf), a wearable sensor platform for high-resolution motion
  analysis.
* Using wearable sensors for measuring [motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's Disease](/papers/parkinsons-titb09.pdf),
  in collaboration with researchers at the [Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital](https://spauldingrehab.org/).
* Wireless sensors for [emergency and mass casualty response](/papers/aidn-ieeehst08.pdf), in
  collaboration with researchers at JHU and Boston University.
* [CitySense](/papers/citysense-ieeehst08.pdf), an urban-scale wireless sensor testbed, consisting
  of wireless sensor nodes deployed across lightpoles in Cambridge, MA. In collaboration with BBN
  Technologies.
* [Cobra](/papers/cobra-nsdi07.pdf), a content-based distributed RSS feed aggregator.
* [IDEA](/papers/idea-mobisys10.pdf), an approach to distributed energy management in a sensor
  network.
* [MoteLab](/papers/motelab-spots05.pdf), an open wireless sensor network testbed.
* [Regiment](/papers/regiment-ipsn07.pdf), a language and runtime for macroprogramming of
  sensor networks.
* [Argos](/papers/argos-sensys10.pdf), a system for distributed measurement of WiFi network traffic
  in an urban setting.
* [Flask](/papers/flask-icfp08.pdf), a functional programming language for sensor networks.
* [Karma](/papers/karma-sensys11.pdf), a programming system for distributed micro-aerial vehicle
  swarms. This research was conducted as part of the
  [RoboBees](https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/robobees-autonomous-flying-microrobots/) project.
* [SORA](/papers/sora-nsdi05.pdf), an approach to decentralized resource allocation in sensor
  networks.
* [WhiteFi](/papers/whitefi-sigcomm09.pdf), a WiFi-like network system operating over UHF
  whitespaces, in collaboration with Microsoft Research.


Prior to Harvard, I was a Senior Researcher at
[Intel Research](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/intel-research.html), Berkeley
from 2002-2003. I did my PhD in Computer Science at [UC Berkeley](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/) (2002)
and my bachelor's in Computer Science at [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) (1996).
